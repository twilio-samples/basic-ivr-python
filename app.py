Description: The code you've provided is a Flask-based Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system that uses Twilio's Voice API. The system allows callers to interact with a phone menu and choose options to get transferred to sales, support, reception, or to hear business hours. 

 Contents:
1. Initialize the Flask application
2. Create helper functions
3. Handle different operations
4. State machine implementation 
5. Define the webhook

This code creates a dynamic voice menu system that directs callers to different options based on input and responds accordingly.
Each time a caller interacts with the IVR, the session keeps track of the current state (ivr_state) so the system knows how to handle 
subsequent requests.

"""
2. Create helper functions
The IVR defines specific functions to handle different states, such as sales, support, and reception.
Each method checks the user input and uses the built in Twilio functions such as Say, Gather, Record, Enqueue, and Dial to interact
with the user. 
"""

def enter_greeting():
    return Say('Welcome to ACME, Inc.')


"""
The "action_on_empty_result=True" parameter passed to Gather ensures that if the gather object times out before the user presses any key,
Twilio will keep the call connected and continue to invoke the application webhook. The default action when a gather timeout occurs 
is to end the call, which does not work well for this application. The num_digits argument tells Twilio that the user needs to key in a single digit.

3. Handle different operations
The hours state needs to play a recorded message with the business hours, and then give the caller the option to repeat the 
message when “1” is pressed, or return to the menu state when any other key is pressed.

There is also a function to navigate back to the menu or repeat the message, as well as error handling and transfer to a reception.

"""
4. State machine implementation 

Each state has a key in the IVR dictionary. The value associated with each state is a tuple with two elements: the “enter” and “exit” actions, respectively.

If the state is a terminal state that does not transition to any other state, then the exit action is None. 
Examples of this are the sales, support and reception states, which transfer the caller and do not ever return to the phone tree.

If the state needs to automatically transition to another state, without waiting for user input, then the exit action is a string 
with the name of the next state. The greeting and error tasks are in this category, as they automatically need to transition to the 
menu task after the enter action is executed.

If the state needs to accept user input to determine where to go next, then the exit action is a function that is invoked after 
input from the user is received.

5. Define the webhook
This webhook finds which state the caller is in from the Flask session variable and then it uses the enter_state() and exit_state() 
auxiliary functions to navigate the state machine. These two functions will find what the enter or exit actions are for the current 
state and return the appropriate TwiML code for Twilio to carry them out.
